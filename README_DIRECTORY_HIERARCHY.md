# Directory Hierarchy

This is a brief orientation to the most significant parts of this repo directory:

```
root/
├── clinicDocs/
├── extensionDirectory/
├── meeting notes/
├── sampleDocketHTML/
├── civic.json
├── README_EXTENSIONS_OVERVIEW.md
└── README.md
```

## clinicDocs/
This director contains copies of all the blank forms that this extension replicates and populates. These blanks are kept only as reference and not otherwise used by the extension.

## extensionDirectory/
This directory contains the code for the ExpungeVT extension and is detailed in README_EXTENSIONS_OVERVIEW.md.

## meeting notes/
Contains meeting notes from the earliest meetings with VLA during the initial attempts to define the ExpungeVT direction & purpose. Kept around mainly due nostalgia and laziness. Kinda neat tho.

## sampleDocketHTML/
Contains sample criminal dockets that have been anonymized. Very useful for testing and allows the public to demo the extension if they don't have access via the official Vermont Case Management System.

## civic.json
Metadata for the project. See http://open.dc.gov/civic.json/

## README_EXTENSIONS_OVERVIEW.md
Brief overview of the chrome extension inside 'extensionDirectory'.

## README.md
A markdown file that generates the website at https://codeforbtv.github.io/expunge-vt/

**NOTE**: Changes to this readme file will be deployed to the public facing site as soon as they are merged into master so make sure your changes are appropriate for the general public.
