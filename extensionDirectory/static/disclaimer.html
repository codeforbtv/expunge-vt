      <p>
        ExpungeVT is a tool created by Code for BTV in collaboration with
        Vermont Legal Aid (collectively the "Contributors"). ExpungeVT, as
        referenced herein, is inclusive of, but is not limited to, the ExpungeVT
        Google Chrome extension, any associated or linked web page, any document
        generated through the extension or related pages, and any other linked
        or otherwise related pages, documentation, materials or information. By agreeing to these terms, you agree to provide, at no cost to the client, expungement or sealing assistance, to at least one (1) client per calendar year within twelve (12) months of the first use of ExpungeVT in that year.
