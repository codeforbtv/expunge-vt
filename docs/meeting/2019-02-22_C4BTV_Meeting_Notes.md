### Notes

| Agenda Item  | Presenter |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Jake noted in an E-mail from Mon, 18-Feb that he would like to see the MoU between VLA and the Office of the Court Administrator. Can Mairead send C4BTV that document? | Mairead |
| 2. Nick Floersch, Micah Mutrux, Jake Durell, and Scott Friedman have reviewed the MoU between C4BTV and VLA. There was some concern over the statement of the delivery time. Scott rewrote that section. Changes (and potential changes) should be discussed with Mairead. | Scott |
| 3. General status of the project. | Scott / Mairead |
| 4. Any new information. | Mairead |

#### Discussion on Agenda Items
1. Mairead will send the MoU between VLA and the court. This document was sent to Jake, Micah, and Scott when the meeting concluded. It has since been placed in the C4BTV Google Drive in the folder "Project / Teams -> ExpungeVT -> Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)". The file name is "MOU Office of the Court Administrator-Vermont Legal Aid 2-28-18.pdf".


2. Scott read the changed text to Mairead during the meeting. The fundamental idea behind the change is not to lock in a 3-month time to delivery for C4BTV. The document is in the C4BTV Google Drive in the folder "Project / Teams -> ExpungeVT. The file name is "Code 4 BTV Memorandum of Understanding".


3. The project status is that Jake has started on some coding tasks. Scott is working with C4BTV and Jake to find at least one programming partner to work with Jake.

4. Mairead talked about the VT courts plans to update their online systems. The start of the changes are targeted for September 2019. The upgrades will roll out across the state over the remainder of 2019 and 2020. This would mean that the mechanism for accessing court records which is a component of the C4BTV ExpungeVT project would need to change from the current plan. C4BTV will need to decide if the ExpungeVT project should continue or be put on-hold until the new software is deployed. Scott thought that since a significant amount of intellectual capital had already been invested in the project, it would continue along its anticipated path with the knowledge that an upgrade will be needed later to accommodate the new court software. Mairead will find out if a demonstration is available for this new software. This news will need to be reviewed with the team and C4BTV principals to decide on the direction of this project. Also, the MoU under development (mentioned above) should note this fact so that it is clear than the anticipated project deliverables would only be a prototype or pilot system.

As a reminder, the ExpungeVT project has been using the following conference connections for internal and client calls:
